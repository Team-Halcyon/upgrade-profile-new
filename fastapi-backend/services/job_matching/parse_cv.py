You are an expert career advisor and HR specialist. Analyze this resume/CV and identify the most suitable job positions/titles that this candidate would be qualified for based on their skills, experience, and qualifications.

Based on the candidate's background shown in this resume, generate a list of specific job titles/positions that they should apply for on job platforms like RemoteOK, Indeed, or LinkedIn Jobs.

Instructions:
1. Focus on the candidate's actual skills, experience level, and expertise
2. Include variations of job titles (e.g., "Software Engineer", "Backend Developer", "Full Stack Developer")
3. Consider their seniority level (Junior, Mid-level, Senior, Lead, etc.)
4. Include both general and specific role titles
5. Focus on positions that match their technical stack and experience
6. Limit to 10-15 most relevant positions

Examples of good job titles:
- "Software Engineer"
- "Frontend Developer" 
- "Java Developer"
- "Senior Python Developer"
- "Full Stack Engineer"
- "Data Scientist"
- "DevOps Engineer"

Return ONLY a Python list format with job positions/titles, like this:
["job title 1", "job title 2", "job title 3", ...]

Do not include any explanations, just the list of job titles that this candidate should search for and apply to.
